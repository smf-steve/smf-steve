# Advice Recap

### Make an Investment in Yourself by Playing

   Play[^1] on projects, any project -- it need not be a requirement for a class or a job.  Such work will improve your understanding of the problem at hand and possible solutions.  

   Even if it is a throw-away project, your efforts will be rewarded with learning new tidbits, tools, and techniques.


   [^1]: **Play**: _to engage in activities for enjoyment and recreation rather than a serious or practical purpose_


### Be Transparent Along your Journey

   Showcase your activities, e.g., via a public repository, where others can see and use the results of all your efforts.  But don't wait till you achieve perfection, allow them to see both your working solutions but also your missteps along the way.  

   We don't learn at the precipice of success, but during the individual steps and missteps along the journey.  So commit early and commit often -- without fear. 


### Coach and Be Coachable

   We all learn through critical[^2] feedback.  We need to acknowledge that effective feedback requires kindness, time, and effort.  We also need to acknowledge, that it is typical that feedback is met with defensiveness.  

   When giving feedback, consider how you couch your message and ensure the feedback is actionable.

   When receiving feedback, listen to the spirit of the message and not necessarily on how it is couched. Listen carefully to extract the most meaningful nuggets.  You are the opportunity to react in the most productive way.


   [^2]: **Critical**: _expressing or involving an analysis of the merits and faults of a work_
