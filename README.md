## Hi there 👋

I am a retired Professor of Computer Science.  During my career, I have held administrative, research, mentoring and teaching based roles.  Regardless of the role at the time, I emphasized my efforts on good mentoring.  

My Github account is where I can role model the advice I have provided to developing and established and CS/CIT professionals throughout my career. I might even be able to provide something of value to others.

Such advise has included:

1. [Make an Investment in Yourself by Playing](advise.md#play)
1. [Be Transparent Along your Journey](advise.md#transparent)
1. [Coach and Be Coachable](advise.md#coach-and-be-coachable)

## 🔭 I’m currently playing on ...
Here is the list of my current or most recent projects for anyone to see.

  1. This README file, and how to better present my activities

  1. Command Line Processing Techniques
     - review of the `getopts` utility
     - learning the gnu version of the `getopt` utility
     - considering a different approach and utility for command line processing

  1. Roman Numerals 
     > [!NOTE]
     > On hold, looking at better ways to do command line processing.

     - conversion from Arabic numbers to roman numbers
     - parsing of roman numbers 

 
I will be making incremental improvements on these projects over time. My commits will illustrate my journey and should not be consider a plateau of development.


## 💬 Provide Your Thoughts and Feedback (<a href="mailto:smf.steve.fitzgerald@gmail.com">Via email 📫 </a>)

I encourage you to provide me with any and all feedback. I will greatly appreciate your time and effort.

I am especially interested in learning:

   1. what other projects I should pursue 
      - perhaps it will lead to collaboration

   1. what previous project that needs work 
      - hopefully because you find it useful

   1. what you know that I should and don't 
      - E.g., this project is superfluous checkout {link}

   1. what bonehead approach I made that I should reconsider 
      - E.g., Hey! try {technique} instead

   1. what is unclear in my documentation or what words I have spelt wrong 
      - my spelling is atrocious.
