## Hi there 👋

I am a retired Professor of Computer Science.  During my career, I have held administrative, research, mentoring and teaching based roles.  Regardless of the role at the time, I emphasized my efforts on good mentoring.  

My Github account is where I can role model the advice I have provided to developing and established and CS/CIT professionals throughout my career. I might even be able to provide something of value to others.

Such advised has included:

1. Make an Investment in Yourself by Playing

   Work on projects, any project -- it need not be a requirement for a class or a job.  Such work will improve your understanding of the problem at hand and possible solutions.  

   Even if it is a throw-away project, your efforts will be rewarded with learning new tidbits, tools, and techniques.


   "Play": to engage in activities for enjoyment and recreation rather than a serious or practical purpose.


1. Be Transparent Along your Journey

   Showcase your activities, e.g., via a public repository, where others can see and use the results of all your efforts.  But don't wait till you achieve perfection, allow them to see both your working solutions but also your missteps along the way.  

   We don't learn at the precipice of success, but during the individual steps and missteps along the journey.  So commit early and commit often -- without fear. 


1. Coach and Be Coachable.

   We all learn through critical feedback.  We need to acknowledge that effective feedback requires kindness, time, and effort.  We also need to acknowledge, that it is typical that feedback is met with defensiveness.  

   When giving feedback, consider how you couch your message and ensure the feedback is actionable.

   When receiving feedback, listen to the spirit of the message and not necessarily on how it is couched. Listen carefully to extract the most meaningful nuggets.  You are the opportunity to react in the most productive way.


   Critical: expressing or involving an analysis of the merits and faults of a work

----
Below is a list of my current/most active projects, for anyone to see. 

I will be making incremental improvements on these projects over time. My commits will illustrate my journey and should not be consider a plateau of development.

I encourage you to provide me with any and all feedback. I will greatly appreciate your time and effort.


I am especially interested in learning

   - what other projects I should pursue (perhaps it leads to collaboration)
   - what previous project that needs work (hopefully because you find it useful)
   - what you know that I should and don't (e.g. a reference to others work
   - what bonehead approach I made that I should reconsider 
   - what words I have spelt wrong -- my spelling is atrocious.
