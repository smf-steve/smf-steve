## Hi there 👋

I am a retired Professor of Computer Science.  During my career, I have held administrative, research, mentoring and teaching based roles.  Regardless of the role at the time, I emphasized my efforts on good mentoring.  

My Github account is where I can role model the advice I have provided to developing and established and CS/CIT professionals throughout my career. I might even be able to provide something of value to others.

---
Such advise has included:

1. [Make an Investment in Yourself by Playing](advise.md#play)
1. [Be Transparent Along your Journey](advise.md#transparent)
1. [Coach and Be Coachable](advise.md#coachable)

----
Below is a list of my current/most active projects, for anyone to see. 

I will be making incremental improvements on these projects over time. My commits will illustrate my journey and should not be consider a plateau of development.

I encourage you to provide me with any and all feedback. I will greatly appreciate your time and effort.


I am especially interested in learning

   - what other projects I should pursue (perhaps it leads to collaboration)
   - what previous project that needs work (hopefully because you find it useful)
   - what you know that I should and don't (e.g. a reference to others work
   - what bonehead approach I made that I should reconsider 
   - what words I have spelt wrong -- my spelling is atrocious.
